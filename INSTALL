To build the 3DO 'Opera' filesystem driver kernel module, you need to have
the following:
* The sources of the Linux kernel for which you are building the module.
  In the instructions below, replace /path/to/kernel_sources by the
  path to the actual root directory of your kernel sources.
* Standard build tools normally used to build a kernel (make, gcc, etc.).


Build the kernel module for the 3DO 'Opera' filesystem driver like this:
	make -C /path/to/kernel_sources M=$PWD modules

Load the module (as root), through:
	insmod operafs.ko

You can also install the module with your other kernel modules:
	make -C /path/to/kernel_sources M=$PWD modules_install
after which you can load the module with:
	modprobe operafs

Now you can mount Opera file systems like any other file system.
You usually need to be root for this.
From a CD-ROM:
	mount -t opera /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
From a CD-ROM disk image:
	mount -t opera -o loop mycd.iso /mnt/cdrom
